## Executive Summary

**Product Name:** Smart Trading Alerts

**Problem Statement:**  
Active traders on our platform miss critical market movements because they can't monitor charts 24/7. Currently, 68% of our users report missing trades due to being away from their screens, resulting in lost opportunities and platform dissatisfaction.

**Proposed Solution:**  
Build an intelligent alert system integrated with TradingView that notifies users via mobile push, email, and SMS when their custom conditions are met. Users can set alerts based on price levels, technical indicators, or AI-detected patterns.

**Success Metrics:**  
- Increase daily active users by 25% within 3 months of launch
- Achieve 40% of users creating at least one alert within first week
- Reduce user churn by 15% quarter-over-quarter
- Generate $30K MRR from premium alert features by month 6

**Launch Target:** Q1 2026

---

## Background & Context

### Why Now?
Our user research shows alerts are the #1 requested feature (mentioned in 43% of support tickets). Competitors like TradingView and Coinigy have alert systems that users cite as reasons for using multiple platforms. We're seeing 12% monthly churn, with "missed opportunities" as the top reason in exit surveys.

Additionally, we just completed TradingView integration, making this the logical next step to leverage that partnership.

### User Research & Insights
- **Research Methods:** 25 user interviews, survey of 500 active users, analysis of 6 months of support tickets
- **Key Findings:**
  - Users check the platform 8-12 times per day on average, causing fatigue
  - 85% of users use mobile devices while away from computer
  - Users want to be alerted to opportunities, not just price movements
  - Current workaround: setting phone reminders and checking manually (high friction)
- **User Quotes:** 
  > "I missed a 15% move last week because I was in a meeting. If I had an alert, I would have caught it."
  
  > "I can't babysit charts all day. I need the platform to watch for me and tell me when something important happens."

### Market Analysis
- **Market Size:** Trading alert tools represent a $2.3B market, growing 18% annually
- **Competitive Landscape:** 
  - TradingView: Basic price alerts (free), advanced technical alerts (premium)
  - Coinigy: Unlimited alerts ($18.66/month)
  - CryptoCompare: Simple price alerts only
- **Differentiation:** We'll integrate AI pattern detection and provide educational context with each alert, helping users understand WHY they received the alert and what action to consider.

### User Goals
1. Never miss important market movements
2. Spend less time manually monitoring charts
3. Make more informed trading decisions with context-rich alerts

## User Personas & Use Cases

### Primary Persona: Active Day Trader (David)
- **Role:** Full-time day trader, 2 years experience
- **Goals:** Capture intraday price movements, manage 5-10 active positions
- **Pain Points:** Can't watch charts during meals, meetings, or sleep
- **Technical Proficiency:** Advanced - uses technical indicators, reads charts daily
- **Context:** Trading from home office, mobile device for on-the-go monitoring

### Secondary Persona: Part-Time Swing Trader (Sarah)
- **Role:** Marketing manager who trades evenings/weekends
- **Goals:** Catch multi-day trends without constant monitoring
- **Pain Points:** Full-time job prevents chart monitoring during market hours
- **Technical Proficiency:** Intermediate - understands basics, learning technical analysis
- **Context:** Checks platform during lunch breaks and after work

### Key Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: Price Level Alert
**Actor:** Active Day Trader (David)  
**Preconditions:** User has TradingView account linked, watching BTC/USD  
**Flow:**
1. User navigates to BTC/USD chart
2. User clicks "Create Alert" button
3. User selects "Price crosses" condition
4. User enters target price: $65,000
5. User selects notification method: Push + Email
6. System validates alert parameters
7. System confirms alert created
8. When BTC hits $65,000, system sends push notification and email

**Expected Outcome:** User receives timely notification and can take action on their trading strategy  
**Edge Cases:** 
- Price crosses threshold during system maintenance → Queue alert, deliver when system recovers
- User has notifications disabled on mobile → Email fallback
- Price moves too quickly, multiple rapid crosses → Deduplicate alerts (5-minute cooldown)

#### Use Case 2: Technical Indicator Alert
**Actor:** Part-Time Swing Trader (Sarah)  
**Preconditions:** User subscribed to Premium tier  
**Flow:**
1. User navigates to ETH/USD chart
2. User clicks "Create Alert" → "Technical Indicator"
3. User selects RSI indicator
4. User sets condition: RSI drops below 30 (oversold)
5. User enables "Educational Context" toggle
6. System creates alert with explanation
7. When RSI drops below 30, system sends notification with context: "RSI indicates ETH may be oversold. This could signal a potential buying opportunity. Learn more about RSI: [link]"

**Expected Outcome:** User receives actionable alert with educational content to help inform their decision  
**Edge Cases:**
- Indicator data delayed from TradingView → Show alert confidence level
- Multiple indicators trigger simultaneously → Batch into single notification

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
| Dependency | Owner | Status | Impact if Delayed | Mitigation |
|------------|-------|--------|-------------------|------------|
| TradingView API access expansion | TradingView Partnership Team | On Track | Can't support advanced indicators | Negotiate priority access, have fallback indicators |
| Mobile push notification infrastructure | Engineering (Ali K.) | On Track | Can't deliver mobile alerts | Web-only launch, add mobile later |
| SendGrid email template approval | Marketing (Can Y.) | At Risk (awaiting brand review) | Delayed email notifications | Use plain text emails as backup |
| Premium billing flow | Engineering (Payment Team) | On Track | Can't monetize premium features | Launch all features free initially |

### Risks & Mitigation

#### High Risk
1. **TradingView API Rate Limits**
   - **Probability:** Medium
   - **Impact:** High (alerts don't fire, user trust damaged)
   - **Mitigation:** Implement intelligent batching, prioritize active alerts, add caching layer, negotiate higher limits
   - **Owner:** Ali K. (Engineering Lead)

2. **Alert Delivery Failure During High Volatility**
   - **Probability:** Medium
   - **Impact:** High (users miss critical trades, potential legal/reputation damage)
   - **Mitigation:** Load testing, auto-scaling notification service, fallback channels, clear SLA in terms
   - **Owner:** Ugur Y. (PM) + Ali K. (Engineering)

#### Medium Risk
1. **User Notification Fatigue**
   - **Probability:** High
   - **Impact:** Medium (users disable notifications, reducing feature value)
   - **Mitigation:** Default to conservative alert limits, add "quiet hours" feature, educate on alert best practices
   - **Owner:** Ugur Y. (PM)

2. **SMS Cost Overruns**
   - **Probability:** Medium
   - **Impact:** Medium (unexpected costs erode margins)
   - **Mitigation:** Rate limit SMS (1 per 5 min per user), make SMS premium-only, monitor costs weekly
   - **Owner:** Ugur Y. (PM) + Finance

### Open Questions
- [ ] Should we allow alert sharing/social features in V1? → Decision by Nov 15
- [ ] What's our refund policy if alerts fail to fire? → Legal review by Nov 20
- [ ] Do we need separate mobile app releases or can we ship web-first? → Discuss with mobile team by Nov 10
- [ ] Should free tier have alert limits or just feature limits? → Finalize pricing by Dec 1
