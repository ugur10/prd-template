# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template

A comprehensive, reusable PRD template for product managers building digital products. This template balances thoroughness with practicality, ensuring you capture all critical information without unnecessary bureaucracy.

## üéØ What's Included

- **PRD_TEMPLATE.md** - The blank template ready for your next product
- **EXAMPLE_PRD.md** - A fully completed example showing best practices
- **README.md** - This guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Copy `PRD_TEMPLATE.md` to your project
2. Rename it to match your product: `PRD_[ProductName].md`
3. Fill out sections as you work through product discovery and definition
4. Review the example PRD to see how each section should be completed
5. Share with stakeholders for feedback and approval

## üìã When to Use This Template

**Use this PRD template when:**
- Building a new product or major feature
- Need stakeholder alignment across engineering, design, and business
- Establishing a product vision and roadmap
- Planning a multi-sprint development effort
- Need clear success criteria and metrics

**Consider a lighter approach when:**
- Making minor bug fixes or UI tweaks
- Running quick experiments or A/B tests
- Building internal tools with single stakeholder
- Working on well-understood, low-risk changes

## üìñ How to Use Each Section

### Executive Summary
**Purpose:** Give busy stakeholders a 2-minute overview  
**Fill out:** Last (after you've completed other sections)  
**Key tip:** If executives only read this section, would they understand the "why" and "what"?

### Background & Context
**Purpose:** Build shared understanding of the problem and opportunity  
**Fill out:** Early, based on user research and market analysis  
**Key tip:** Include actual user quotes and data - avoid generic statements like "users want this"

### Goals & Success Criteria
**Purpose:** Define what success looks like before you build anything  
**Fill out:** After background research, before any design/development  
**Key tip:** Make metrics specific and measurable - "increase engagement" is not a metric, "increase DAU by 15%" is

### User Personas & Use Cases
**Purpose:** Keep the team focused on real user needs  
**Fill out:** Based on user research, interviews, and data analysis  
**Key tip:** Use real names and details - personas should feel like actual people on your team

### Product Requirements
**Purpose:** Define exactly what you're building and in what order  
**Fill out:** Collaboratively with engineering and design  
**Key tip:** Be ruthless about MVP scope - most P1 features can wait for post-launch

### Non-Functional Requirements
**Purpose:** Define the quality attributes beyond features  
**Fill out:** With engineering input - these often have architectural implications  
**Key tip:** Don't skip this! Performance, security, and scalability issues are expensive to fix later

### User Experience & Design
**Purpose:** Align the team on how the product should feel and flow  
**Fill out:** After requirements, in collaboration with designers  
**Key tip:** Link to actual design files rather than trying to describe everything in text

### Technical Specifications
**Purpose:** Give engineers enough detail to architect the solution  
**Fill out:** With engineering lead - may require separate detailed technical doc  
**Key tip:** Focus on constraints, integrations, and architectural decisions rather than implementation details

### Go-to-Market Strategy
**Purpose:** Ensure the product reaches users and achieves business goals  
**Fill out:** In collaboration with marketing, sales, and support teams  
**Key tip:** Launch is not the finish line - plan for ongoing marketing and iteration

### Dependencies & Risks
**Purpose:** Identify blockers and create mitigation plans before they derail the project  
**Fill out:** Throughout the process, update regularly  
**Key tip:** Be honest about risks - pretending they don't exist doesn't make them go away

### Timeline & Milestones
**Purpose:** Set expectations and track progress  
**Fill out:** With engineering estimates, add buffer for unknowns  
**Key tip:** Timelines will slip - build in contingency and communicate proactively

### Post-Launch Plan
**Purpose:** Define how you'll measure success and iterate  
**Fill out:** Before launch so you're ready to act on data  
**Key tip:** Schedule check-ins in advance - don't wait to "find time" after launch

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Customizing the Template

**Feel free to:**
- Remove sections that don't apply to your product
- Add custom sections for your company's specific needs
- Adjust the level of detail based on project complexity
- Modify the format to match your company's style

**But keep:**
- Clear problem statement and success metrics
- User-focused requirements with acceptance criteria
- Risk identification and mitigation plans
- Stakeholder approval section

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Your First PRD
- Don't try to fill out everything at once - PRDs are living documents
- Start with "Executive Summary" and "Goals & Success Criteria" to get alignment
- Use the example PRD as a reference for tone and level of detail
- Share early drafts with key stakeholders to avoid surprises

### For Experienced PMs
- Adapt the template to your team's workflow - don't follow it blindly
- Focus on sections that drive decisions and alignment
- Link to external docs rather than duplicating information
- Keep it updated throughout development - a stale PRD is worse than no PRD

### For Stakeholder Review
- Send the "Executive Summary" first to gauge interest
- Schedule a review meeting - don't just email the doc
- Ask for specific feedback: "Does the MVP scope feel right?" vs "What do you think?"
- Get written approval from key stakeholders

## üîÑ PRD Lifecycle

1. **Draft** - PM creates initial version based on research
2. **Review** - Stakeholders provide feedback, PM iterates
3. **Approved** - Key stakeholders sign off, development begins
4. **Living Document** - Update as you learn during development
5. **Archived** - After launch, keep for historical reference and learning

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools That Work Well With This Template

- **Markdown Editors:** VS Code, Notion, Typora, Obsidian
- **Collaboration:** GitHub, GitLab, Confluence, Google Docs (convert to Markdown)
- **Design Links:** Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD
- **Analytics:** Mixpanel, Amplitude, Google Analytics
- **Project Management:** Jira, Linear, Asana
