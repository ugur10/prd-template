# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template

A practical, battle-tested PRD template for product managers building digital products. Comprehensive enough to drive alignment, concise enough to actually get used.

## What's Different

This template strikes the balance between thoroughness and usability. It's based on patterns from leading tech companies but adapted for real-world constraints—you can skip sections that don't apply, but the critical elements (problem statement, success metrics, user focus) are non-negotiable.

## Quick Start

1. Copy [PRD_TEMPLATE.md](PRD_TEMPLATE.md) to your project
2. Fill out Goals & Success Criteria first to establish alignment
3. Reference [EXAMPLE_PRD.md](EXAMPLE_PRD.md) for guidance on tone and depth
4. Iterate with stakeholders throughout discovery and development

## What's Included

- **[PRD_TEMPLATE.md](PRD_TEMPLATE.md)** - Clean template ready for your next product
- **[EXAMPLE_PRD.md](EXAMPLE_PRD.md)** - Fully completed example demonstrating best practices
- **README.md** - This guide

## When to Use This Template

**Use a full PRD for:**
- New products or major features requiring cross-functional alignment
- Multi-sprint development efforts with significant engineering investment
- Projects needing clear success metrics and stakeholder approval
- Initiatives with meaningful business or user impact

**Use something lighter for:**
- Minor bug fixes, UI tweaks, or well-understood changes
- Quick experiments or A/B tests with single stakeholders
- Internal tools with minimal complexity

## Core Sections Explained

**Executive Summary** - Write this last. If stakeholders only read one section, they should understand the why, what, and expected impact.

**Background & Context** - Use real data and user quotes. Avoid generic problem statements.

**Goals & Success Criteria** - Define measurable outcomes before building. "Increase DAU by 15%" not "improve engagement."

**User Personas & Use Cases** - Base on research, not assumptions. Make personas feel real.

**Product Requirements** - Be ruthless about MVP scope. Most P1 features can wait for v2.

**Non-Functional Requirements** - Don't skip this. Performance, security, and scale are expensive to fix later.

**Dependencies & Risks** - Identify blockers early. Honesty about risks enables better planning.

**Post-Launch Plan** - Schedule success measurement check-ins before launch, not after.

## Customizing This Template

**Feel free to:**
- Remove sections irrelevant to your product or organization
- Adjust detail level based on project complexity
- Add company-specific sections or modify formatting
- Link to external documents rather than duplicating content

**Always keep:**
- Clear problem statement with user evidence
- Measurable success criteria
- User-focused requirements with acceptance criteria
- Risk identification and mitigation plans
- Stakeholder approval

## Best Practices

### PRD Lifecycle
1. **Draft** - PM creates initial version from research
2. **Review** - Stakeholders provide feedback, PM iterates
3. **Approved** - Key stakeholders sign off
4. **Living Document** - Update as you learn during development
5. **Archive** - Preserve for historical reference after launch

### Tips for Effective PRDs
- Start with Executive Summary and Goals to get early alignment
- Share drafts early to avoid surprises
- Ask for specific feedback ("Does MVP scope feel right?") not vague input
- Keep updated during development—stale PRDs create confusion
- Link to design files, specs, and analytics rather than duplicating
- Get written approval from decision-makers

### Collaboration Tools
- **Markdown editors:** VS Code, Notion, Obsidian, Typora
- **Version control:** GitHub, GitLab, Confluence
- **Design:** Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD
- **Analytics:** Mixpanel, Amplitude, Google Analytics
- **Project management:** Jira, Linear, Asana
